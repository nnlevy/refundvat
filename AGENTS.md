## Income first: standing rules from Nir (read before any work)

These rules apply to every AI agent session in this repo (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Copilot, Grok Bot). They come before anything else in this file.

1. **Money path for this repo (refundvat.info).** Every change must name which link of this chain it moves (visit → tool use → signup → credits / paid step → Stripe revenue or AdSense), and every plan, page, tool, guide, brief and PR opens with this money-path line.
   - **For users:** getting back every VAT euro they are owed (eligibility scan, claim letters, country playbooks).
   - **For Nir:** AdSense (ads.txt `pub-1860356577073395`); no hub catalog or paid step today (operated via growth.business).
   - **Paid path:** free eligibility check (AdSense on playbooks); any paid step must reuse growth.business / portfolio credits.
2. **One income source of truth.** Read the shared income ledger before quoting any traffic or revenue number or proposing work: `/workspace/income/INCOME-SSOT.json` on the Grok Bot box (traffic alias: `/workspace/traffic/TRAFFIC-SSOT.json`; agents without box access ask the Chief of Staff for the current figure). It covers the whole chain: visits (Cloudflare Web Analytics RUM real page loads by source only) → tool uses → signups → credits → Stripe revenue → AdSense. Update it after any measurement (`python3 /workspace/traffic/record.py ...` or `refresh_traffic.py`). Never report Cloudflare zone "unique visitors" as visits (mostly bots). Say "zero Google visits" precisely, never "zero visits". If the entry is older than 36h, re-measure before quoting. Never invent numbers.
3. **Priority order.** Traffic/indexing and new guides → AdSense approval/placement → paid conversion → security only when it leaks money or data, or blocks AdSense.
4. **Dashboard over freebies.** Integrate tools into the logged-in user dashboard with a paid path (existing credits, paid steps, existing Stripe products) instead of shipping standalone free tools. Never create new Stripe products or prices, or change pricing, without Nir. Never expose Nir's private ops dashboard.
